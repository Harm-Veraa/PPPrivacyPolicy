Child Safety Standards Policy

At PointsPotty, the safety of all our users is our highest priority, and we are committed to ensuring our platform is a safe and respectful space for everyone. In accordance with Google Play’s Child Safety Standards, we have established the following policies to protect against child sexual abuse and exploitation and to comply with applicable child safety laws.

‍

1. Zero Tolerance for Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)

We have a zero-tolerance policy for child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) on our platform. Any accounts found to be engaging in such activities will be permanently banned and reported to the appropriate authorities for further action.

‍

2. Published Standards Against CSAE

PointsPotty strictly prohibits:

    The sharing, solicitation, or promotion of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).
    The use of the platform for grooming, exploitation, or any other behavior that endangers children.
    Any content or communication that violates child protection laws.

We adhere to global best practices, including those set by the Tech Coalition, to combat online child sexual abuse and exploitation.

3. Reporting Mechanism

PointsPotty provides an easy-to-use reporting mechanism within the app to help users flag inappropriate behavior or content, including potential CSAE. Here’s how it works:

    Users can report a profile or chat by emailing pointspotty@gmail.com.
    Upon selecting “Report,” users are prompted to choose a reason for the report and provide additional details.
    All reports related to CSAE are automatically escalated to our legal department for immediate review and action.

4. Addressing Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)

When reports of CSAM are received, PointsPotty:

    Immediately removes the offending content and blocks the responsible account.
    Reports the content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) or other appropriate authorities in compliance with applicable laws.
    Cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies to ensure swift action.

    The identification and reporting of child sexual exploitation.
    Data privacy and security regulations to protect minors.
